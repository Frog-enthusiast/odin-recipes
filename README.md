# odin-recipes

Introduction:

This is my first ever project with a focus on using HMTL to complete a recipe website. The website will contain the fundamentals of HTML to include HTML boiler plate, tag elements such as paragraphs, images, and lists. The website will also utilize links to other pages within the recipe website. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did creating it with the help of The Odin Project.

Reflection:

This was pretty daunting at first for me to do, but once I started creating the directories and html pages, it quickly became a fun and engaging project. I had trouble at the start trying to remember the git terminal commands but a quick lesson refresher for git got me up to speed and now I'm more comfortable with the terminal. I had to take some extra time to make sure my images had alt text to make it accessable for everyone.

I also had to review a bit on creating commits and adding proper messages to said commits. It's definitely smart to do it often and early.

Overall, I'm proud of what I created with the help of The Odin Project. This for sure has me excited for whats to come.
