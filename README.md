# odin-recipes

Introduction:

This is my first ever project with a focus on using HMTL to complete a recipe website. The website will contain the fundamentals of HTML to include HTML boiler plate, tag elements such as paragraphs, images, and lists. The website will also utilize links to other pages within the recipe website. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did creating it with the help of The Odin Project.
